## Lab Tasks

As usual, some of the lab tasks could change a bit before Wednesday, but the
general outline is here.

Note that the _skill demonstration_ description is firm, and we'll only add
clarifications and extra information, not change the task, at this point.

Today is a bit “potpourri” and a bit “choose your own adventure.” There are a
few short things I want to make sure everyone does, and then a few _options_ for
how to spend your time. These include some cool tips and tricks that might help
you out in the future, some situations that students have run into explicitly in
class, and a space to chat about what you're doing for your skill demo.

Do the **required tasks**, then as a group pick some of the others to try.  If
you have time, do them all!

### Required Task – Synchronize Your Group Work

You've all done some work either in the same repository or in different
repositories over the last few labs. Take some time to make sure everyone has
the most up-to-date version of the `markdown-parse` you're working on as a
group. You could do this in a few ways; figure out which strategy works best for
your group! For example, you might:

- Put all links to Github repositories in your shared notes doc
- Have one person add all the tests + fixes from the other repository to their
repository
- Have everyeone else copy that work back to their own copy
- Have everyone pull/clone their copy and make sure they can run the tests

**Write in notes**: Include screenshots from each group member getting it all to
work.

### Required Task – Setup Github Actions on a Repository

In class on Monday, we saw how to create a Github Action that would run our
tests. Refer to that video. Set up a Github Action that runs your JUnit tests
from last week. (You can see how it was set up here:
[https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w22/markdown-parse](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w22/markdown-parse)).

Commit and push a failing test. How does it show up on Github? Do you get any
other notifications?

Commit and push a fix to the test. How does it show up on Github? Do you get any
other notifications?

**Write in notes**: Take screenshots of and copy links to the output from the
above steps.

### Required Task – Improve `markdown-parse`

In the past few labs, you worked on adding tests and improving `markdown-parse`.

Do this once more – add one new **failure-inducing input**, add it as a JUnit
test, then commit and push with the failing output in the commit message.

Then, come up with a fix/improvement to the code to address this case while
still succeeding on all the previous test cases. Commit and push the change.

**Write in notes**: Add the links to the commits you made above.


### Group Choice 1 – Streamline `ssh` Configuration

When you log into `ieng6` from your laptop, you type something like:

```
$ ssh cs15lwi22zzz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```

That's a lot to type and remember! SSH, like many programs, has configuration
files that can save you some typing. You can put an entry in `~/.ssh/config`
that tells SSH what username to use when logging into specific servers, and even
give servers nicknames. For example, try opening `~/.ssh/config` (on _your_
computer, creating it if it doesn't exist), and adding these lines:

```
Host ieng6
    HostName ieng6.ucsd.edu
    User cs15lwi22zzz (use your username)
```

And then try this command:

```
ssh ieng6
```

If things are set up correctly, this should use the key and log you in with the
username you specified using your public key.

If this doesn't work, you can try adding a line to explicitly refer to your
`id_rsa` file:

```
Host ieng6
    HostName ieng6.ucsd.edu
    User cs15lwi22zzz (use your username)
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_ucsd
```

Note that paths may look a little different on Windows, they may use `\` instead
of `/` for instance. Talk with your group and think about any errors you get,
and if they could be related to paths or other issues you've seen in the past!

**Write in notes**: Take screenshots of your new login that's faster and easier
to type! It will look something like this:

```
⤇ ssh ieng6
Last login: Tue Feb  1 15:54:09 2022 from joes-mbp.dynamic.ucsd.edu
quota: No filesystem specified.
Hello cs15lwi22, you are currently logged into ieng6-201.ucsd.edu

You are using 0% CPU on this system

Cluster Status
Hostname     Time    #Users  Load  Averages
ieng6-201   15:55:01   21  0.25,  0.44,  0.62
ieng6-202   15:55:01   20  0.11,  0.07,  0.07
ieng6-203   15:55:01   13  1.27,  1.32,  1.28


Tue Feb 01, 2022  3:56pm - Prepping cs15lwi22
[cs15lwi22@ieng6-201]:~:93$
```

You can change `ieng6` after `Host` to another name if you like; it's an alias
you are inventing for `ssh` to interpret.

### Group Choice 2 – Set up Github Access from ieng6

In command-line `git`, we saw in class how to use `clone` and `pull` to get code
from Github, and `git status` to check the status. We didn't see as much how to
`commit` and `push` from the command line. In fact, if you try to do this from
the command line, you'll likely see an error! Here's what it looks like for me
after I make an edit to `MarkdownParse.java` and try to add, commit, and push
it:

```
⤇ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   MarkdownParse.java

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
⤇ git add MarkdownParse.java
⤇ git commit -m "adding a line"
[main 4cbda16] adding a line
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
⤇ git push origin main
Username for 'https://github.com': jpolitz
Password for 'https://jpolitz@github.com':
remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021. Please use a personal access token instead.
remote: Please see https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/ for more information.
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-wi22/markdown-parse/'
```

The error message, with [this article
referenced](https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/),
explains that you can _no longer_ use a password for this operation. You _must_
use a token-based login mechanism like SSH keys.

To address this, you can follow the instructions here in [this
tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
to add the _public key_ you made as part of the remote access lab to Github. You
can also make a new SSH key and have one for your access to `ieng6` and one for
access to Github. Try it!

**Write in notes**: You'll know you've succeeded when you can use `git push
origin main` after committing to push your changes to Github from the command
line.

#### Managing Multiple Keys

If you do make another key, you can also make a change to your `.ssh/config` on
your computer to have an entry for Github. For example, Joe has this entry in
his `.ssh/config`:

```
Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    User jpolitz
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github
```

When I made that key, I didn't just press `Enter` to use the default filename,
but made a new file by writing out the path to it:

```
⤇ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/joe/.ssh/id_rsa): /Users/joe/.ssh/id_rsa_github
```

#### A Key on ieng6

For even more command-line pushing fun, you can _also_ run `ssh-keygen` while
logged into your course-specific account, then copy the public key to Github
following the tutorial above. That will allow you to push to Github from the
`ieng6` machines. If you're working on those computers while physically in the
labs, it's a good idea to get this set up!

This kind of use case is why Github lets you upload multiple different public
keys.

### Group Choice 3 – Copy Whole Directories with `scp -r`

We've often been working with entire _directories_ of files (like with `lib/`).
Our strategies for copying a single file with `scp` from week 1 won't
necessarily work as a result, or at least will be much more onerous (we'd have
to copy file after file). And with subdirectories like `lib/`, we'd have to
figure out how make the directories on the remote server, and then copy the
files inside... tiring and error prone!

Thankfully, `scp` has an option for handling this. We can ask `scp` to copy
_recursively_, meaning it will copy a directory and all the files and
directories within it, and all the files and directories within those, and so
on.

That means we could copy our whole `markdown-parse` directory to the server with
one command (and then use other tools we know to run the code there).

Say we're in a terminal, and the working directory is our checkout of
`markdown-parse`:

```
⤇ pwd
/Users/joe/src/markdown-parse
⤇ ls
MarkdownParse.java     test-file2.md          test-file6.md
MarkdownParseTest.java test-file3.md          test-file7.md
lib                    test-file4.md          test-file8.md
test-file.md           test-file5.md
```

We can use `scp` to copy _this directory_ (represented by `.`) to the remote
server. We also have to give a name of the directory we want it to copy into on
the remote server:

```
$ scp -r . cs15lwi22@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/markdown-parse
```

The `-r` option tells `scp` to work recursively. The `.` is the _source_, and is
the current directory. The `~/markdown-parse` tells `scp` to create the
`markdown-parse` directory on the remote server (if it doesn't exist), and then
copy the contents of this directory recursively there.

If we do this, then we can log into the server with `ssh` and see all of our
files there in a directory called `markdown-parse`:

```
⤇ scp -r . ieng6:markdown-parse
test-file5.md                                 100%   39    13.5KB/s   00:00
MarkdownParseTest.java                        100%  568   205.4KB/s   00:00
...
test-file6.md                                 100%   27    12.8KB/s   00:00
test-file2.md                                 100%  110    56.1KB/s   00:00
⤇ ssh cs15lwi22@ieng6.ucsd.edu
[cs15lwi22@ieng6-201]:~:99$ ls markdown-parse
MarkdownParse.java      test-file.md   test-file4.md  test-file7.md
MarkdownParseTest.java  test-file2.md  test-file5.md  test-file8.md
lib                     test-file3.md  test-file6.md
```

Note that when we do this it copies not just the files we see with `ls`, but
_all_ of the files in `.git` as well. This is fine for most uses you'll run
into. However, you can have more control over what gets copied. Try this command:

```
⤇ scp -r *.java *.md lib/ cs15lwi22@ieng6.ucsd.edu:markdown-parse
```

What does that copy? What do you think `*.java` and `*.md` mean?

**Write in notes**: Take a screenshot of copying the files with `scp` as above.
Can you come up with a way to write a single command that will copy a whole
directory, then `ssh` to the server and run a command?

Note that if you did the first option for streamlining your .ssh configuration,
you can use the short name for `ieng6` in all of these `scp` and `ssh` commands!
For example you could shorten the second command to

```
⤇ scp -r *.java *.md lib/ ieng6:markdown-parse
```

(A useful reference on `scp -r` is this [answer
online on serverfault](https://serverfault.com/questions/264595/can-scp-copy-directories-recursively))

### Group Choice 4 – Discuss Strategies for Skill Demo Video

Have a conversation about tips, techniques, and strategies for your first skill
demonstration video! The sample video and task is below. Feel free to ask
questions about it on Piazza.

## Skill Demonstration 1

For your first skill demonstration video, you will record a screencast of
yourself (using Zoom is one good way) demonstrating some of the concrete skills
you learned in the first 4 weeks of the course.

### Task

In the video, show:

- Your face + a photo ID (that's the only time you have to show your face)
- Creating a new repository on Github
- Creating a file with a Java class
- Creating another file with a JUnit test for a method in that class, the test
must *fail* initially
- Add any code/libraries needed to make the JUnit test run
- Commiting all of the code/libraries required for running that test
- Running the test in your `cs15l` course-specific account
- Fix the test so it *passes*, then run it again on your `cs15l1` account and
commit/push the changes (you can commit/push and run the update in any order)

### Constraints and Examples

You must do this all in one take (you can't stitch together multiple videos) and
the video needs to be less than 15 minutes. Probably your first try won't be 15
minutes – you may have to practice several times to get the process down to 15
minutes; you are free to ask for any help you need in getting your own process
down to that time!

The classes and method you create can be anything, and you could copy/paste
their contents from somewhere, but you have to create the files as part of your
video.

Similarly, you have to create a new repository as part of the video, perform all
commits as part of the video, show the tests running as part of the video, and
so on.

It's up to you how to run the test in your `cs15l` account:

- You could `scp` the relevant files after they are created and/or updated
- You could `ssh` into your account and clone the repository, then `pull` on updates
- You could do something else that you prefer

Here's an example of Joe doing the task:

A brief tutorial on how to make a recording with Zoom is here:

[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KROMAQuTCk40zwrEFotlYSJJQdcG_GUU](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KROMAQuTCk40zwrEFotlYSJJQdcG_GUU)


### Submission

The video must be submitted by **5pm Friday, February 4**.

Upload your video file to the Skill Demonstration 1 - Video assignment on
Gradescope. Make sure to try uploading well in advance of the deadline for two
reasons:

1. Make sure that you aren't recording an extremely large/high-definition video;
there are some (reasonable) file-size limits
2. Make sure you have time to upload the video

If something goes wrong for you uploading near the deadline (for example, you
only have a link to a video instead of an actual video to upload for some
reason), upload a README file explaining the situation to the best of your
ability instead of the video itself.

Once submitted, you should be able to see the video file you uploaded and check
that it plays within Gradescope. Please do so!
